# Impacts on Society

Course Name: Introduction to Data Science
Course Description:
Grade Level(s): 11th and 12th grade students, having already taken Algebra 1 and Geometry

This outline will describe how this Data Science course will incorporate the societal impact on computing, ethical considerations in computing, and ways that the instruction in this course will address equity and inclusion.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

Assessments of the learning objectives outlined above will be assessed through various means such as formative assessments, coding+spreadsheet check-ins, and projects but implementing the skills represented in those objectives within those assignments. For example:

Students must create their graphs, charts, etc. using colorblind friendly palettes
Since data collection is sometimes a time consuming process, while the class waits for data to come in, we will introduce data ethics topics during class.
Students must reflect on the data ethics for each one of their unit projects. Sample prompts that they will respond to include: "Expresses any potential biases in data, collection, and analysis", "Considers how mediating or confounding variables can impact the validity of claims made from your data", and "Reflects on data collection methods and potential bias for your local data and state data. 



### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
