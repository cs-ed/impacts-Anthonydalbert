# Impacts on Society

Course Name: Introduction to Data Science
Course Description:
Grade Level(s): 11th and 12th grade students, having already taken Algebra 1 and Geometry

This outline will describe how this Data Science course will incorporate the societal impact on computing, ethical considerations in computing, and ways that the instruction in this course will address equity and inclusion.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Students will defend their choice of colorblind friendly color palette.
Students will examine the privacy policies of different media apps and websites and discuss their impacts.
Students will critique articles and data displays to understand how data can be misused to ephasize one side of an arguement.
Students will collect and analyze data from digital print media to determine if certain skin tones are misrepresented in magazines.
Students will reflect on their own personal bias to determine how it affects their work as a data scientist.
Students will compare their personal experiences learning to program to the experiences of those in the articles we have read.

### Learning Activities

Journal entry reflections will occur throughout the course multiple times per week.

Coding assignments will occur at least once per week as formative assessments.

Internet research (and data collection) will take place alongside all of the unit projects and most of the coding assignments, which would include checks for any bias.

There will be 8 unit projects throughout the course that follow the data science process and include checks to make sure it is inclusive and any bias is minimalized

Warm Ups are daily and involve looking at data, articles, graphs, etc. and understanding the message they convey and the impact of that message. There is a follow up class discussion after all warm ups.

### Assessment

Assessments of the learning objectives outlined above will be assessed through various means such as formative assessments, coding+spreadsheet check-ins, and projects but implementing the skills represented in those objectives within those assignments. For example:

Students must create their graphs, charts, etc. using colorblind friendly palettes

Since data collection is sometimes a time consuming process, while the class waits for data to come in, we will introduce data ethics topics during class.

Students must reflect on the data ethics for each one of their unit projects. Sample prompts that they will respond to include: "Expresses any potential biases in data, collection, and analysis", "Considers how mediating or confounding variables can impact the validity of claims made from your data", and "Reflects on data collection methods and potential bias for your local data and state data. 

Students will have weekly reflections in their Data Science journals, at least one of which will focus on the societal impacts of computing.


### Outcomes

In this course, students will begin to see how all students can and should be represented in the world of computing. I believe this starts with the way that the school decides to place students in this course. Since this course has Algebra 1 and Geometry as prerequisites, which all students are required to take, it is truly accessible to all students. In addtion, since there are no grade requirements (you only have had to pass the prerequisites), this class is not skill-prohibitive. This course also meets the CA A-G requirement as an upper division math class (can be taken in leiu of Algebra 2), so students don't give up the chance at a 4 year college by taking this course. The fact that this course has such a low floor entry, it is a course that is truly accessible to all students in the school. 

In addition, in the learning objectives above, I have outlined some of the lessons in the course that outline the long-term goals of adressing computing impacts on society. These lessons are specifically focused on how computing + data have and continue to impact society. 

Finally, it is my belief that by having lessons woven throughout the course that focus on topics in diversity, it gives students taking the course that diversity and inclusion is important, and is something that they should also consider and focus on in their computing journey.
